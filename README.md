# Mekanism for Minecraft 1.21 #

Mekanism is an independent Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features on the [**Official Wiki**](https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Mekanism).
With features ranging from jetpacks and balloons to factories and energy cubes, the mod does not have a single unifying goal.
Nevertheless, these features combine coherently to create a rich gameplay experience that players will enjoy.

Mekanism uses a tier-based system to organize the majority of its core features, like energy cubes and factories.
There are four tiers: basic, advanced, elite, and ultimate. Players can upgrade their components to the next tier
by placing each component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the upgrade or in
world by using tier installers.

After using Mekanism for a while, players can obtain a near-indestructible suit of Refined Obsidian Armor, receive five 
ingots for each ore mined, fly with hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have cute robotic friends following them around while they mine. :)
