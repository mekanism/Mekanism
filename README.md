# Mekanism for Minecraft 1.15 #

Mekanism is a Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features at the [**Official Website**](http://aidancbrady.com/mekanism/).
Mekanism is an independent tech mod that brings low, mid, and high tier machinery to Minecraft. The 
mod doesn't have an actual goal, and you'll understand this when you see all the random content 
Mekanism contains, from jetpacks to balloons. However, I can assure you that you'll notice all the 
content blend together as you get to know the mod better!

Mekanism uses a tier-based system when organizing several of its core features, including Energy 
Cubes and Factories. There are four tiers: basic, the simplest tier, advanced, the second-most basic 
tier, elite, the second-most complex tier, and ultimate, the most complex tier. You can upgrade 
tiers by placing the component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources 
for the next upgrade.

By the time you've been using Mekanism for a while, you'll have a near-instructible suit of Obsidian 
Armor, be obtaining four ingots for each ore you mine, have the ability to fly wherever you want with 
the hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have a cute robotic friend following you around while you mine. :)

# Alpha Status #

Mekanism for 1.15 is currently in an alpha state. The majority of basic features are working properly, while
other things like inventories for multiblocks are in a more broken state. We are currently working on
refactoring multiple large portions of the code to make Mekanism easier to maintain and add new features
to. Because of this, the internals are in flux and may be changed greatly so we may also make breaking
changes to our API while Mekanism is in alpha. We also are making sure to keep the “alpha” state during
this time so that we don’t have to spend extra time worrying about if the world doesn’t lose any data
from one commit to the next, and for this reason we do not recommend including Mekanism in any "large"
packs that players may expect things to work properly/upgrade safely from one version to the next.
