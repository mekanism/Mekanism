Licenses are not really my friend -- strict closed source software really drives me nuts. Even more, with a derivative work coded in a language such as Java, nothing can really prevent people from looking through my source with JD-GUI. I learned to program through a combination of textbooks, trial-and-error and browsing open source projects. As such, I have decided to license Mekanism under the MIT license, allowing for anyone with an interest in the project to fork/pull/distribute.
