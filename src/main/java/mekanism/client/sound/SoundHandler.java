/**
 * SoundHandler is the central point for sounds on Mek client side. There are roughly three classes of sounds to deal with:
 *
 * <ol>
 *  <li>One-shot sounds like GUI interactions; play the sound and done</li>
 *  <li>Long-lived player item sounds (such as jetpacks): long-running sounds that may flip on/off quickly based on user action. We follow the minecart model for
 *      these sounds; starting a sound and then muting when not in use.</li>
 *  <li>Tile entity sounds: long-running, repeating sounds that run while a fixed tile is active. These are sounds that users want to be able to mute effectively.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * All sounds, when initially started can be intercepted on the Forge event bus and wrapped by various muting/manipulation mods. For item sounds, we don't want to them to
 * be manipulated, since the flipping on/off is too prone to weird timing issues. For long-running sounds, we need a way to honor these attempted manipulations, without
 * allowing them to become the permanent state of the sound (which is what happens by default). To accomplish this, we have our own wrapper that intercepts new repeating
 * sounds from Mek and ensures that they periodically poll for any muting/manipulation so that the object can dynamically adjust to any conditions.
